## 4:35 PM EST - Laying in the Grass... somewhere under the sun in Durham, NC ðŸ˜Ž

For if I were not Andrew Weisbeck, the homeless man with a computer, I'd be Andrew Weisbeck, the homeless beat making man... also with a computer...

I am learning music theory right now as my break hour from work/coding/writing today. I've got some exciting things coming up soon - very soon. I don't know if it will be tonight now because some things happened during my day that totally derailed everything I was up to.

The main reason I didn't get the last couple daily posts up was because I literally couldn't do it on my computer. You want to know what I did on Sunday? I was going to the bathroom before I left Wegman's at 11:30, about 30 minutes before they close. Now I was stoned as a Basilisk's stare, and after I used the bathroom, I didn't even think about it and just walked all the way on home, not stopping once to think, "Hey, this back pack is light yo!". Nope, not at all and I thought I was never going to get it back, but they ended up finding it and returning it to me, thank god.

It was great to get my computer back, but today was just totally twisted - most days are out here, but whatever...
