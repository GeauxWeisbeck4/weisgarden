## v0.0.1 Release Notes

There is not much to share with this release since the main purpose of v0.0.1 is to make sure everything builds correctly and at least deploys to Netlify. It provides an opportunity for me to also set up processes for this project and others.

This post will serve as an outline/framework for WeisGarden releases in the future.

## Performance/Benchmarks

If there is anything to go here, it will be related to build time, etc.

## New Features

Any new features added to the site or updated. For v0.0.1, I built out the basic structure and styling for the site and that's about it. v0.1.0 is deploying very soon, so not too worried.

## Other Changes

Any other changes that may have happened. Since it was the very first release, nothing changed except there's now a project and website!
