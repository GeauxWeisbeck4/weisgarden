## 9:24 PM - Sunday Evening

I am at Wegman's working (like usual) and here's what's happening right now:

## Listening:


## Working On:

- [WeisGarden](https://weisgarden.netlify.app)
  - Hopefully getting some aesthetic things done. Need to focus on the donation page and projects page however.

## Where I'm Working:

- [Wegman's in Chapel Hill, NC](https://example.com)
  - Just got here and trying to get some stuff done before tomorrow. Ugh, the struggle is real right now.

## What's on My Mind:

When you have been like I have been for long enough, there are just some days that feel straight hopeless. I don't know if today is one of those, but thinking about some things has me feeling like, "Damn, wtf do I do? WTF does anyone do about this?"

It's not just about my current situation and my lack of resources, finances, and current living situation - it is actually very much a condition of humanity that I can't stop thinking about. What could that be you are thinking? Our addiction to money.

Yes, us humans are quite addicted to money, if that isn't already obvious. From our preoccupation to our enabling of really bad things to happen, we allow this make believe thing printed on paper by a government we despise, to dictate our entire lives. Just think about it...

- Every war - started because of money. Think not? If you want to argue WWII was about stopping fascism, well think about what allowed fascism to rise - poor economic conditions in Germany. Think invading Afghanistan and Iraq weren't about money, but instead were because of 9/11 and weapons of mass destruction? Well we now know 9/11 was orchestrated by very rich and powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the US, plus we proved very quickly that WMDs were an excuse to invade Iraq.
- Addiction exists because of money... and it does. If there was no money, who would supply the addictive drugs that are killing people every day? How do addicts continue to get their drug of choice? Money. There's even an entire economy built around addiction - recovery centers, legal systems, and the black market for drugs. I'll come back to this later on/another post.
- Follow the money - all crimes basically follow one trail, and that trail is money. Look at anything going on in the world right now that reeks of corruption. Money is the number one culprit, piece of evidence, and motivation for the crime. Minus a few serial killers and other flat out psychopaths who have committed serious crimes, almost everything leads back to doing a crime so the criminal can get what? You guessed it, money!

You might say, "Oh but Andrew, that is such a simplistic explanation for all the world problems! It can't be that simple! We are humans, complex and deep beings who are much deeper than some dead presidents printed on paper." 

I disagree, in most cases, but we really are motivated by money because it helps us get the resources that we need, and that creates massive imbalances in a world that is built on mother nature, something that is fragile and requires a delicate balance of processes to survive. We as humans feel like we have conquered this fine balance with intelligence and hard work, but I feel like we have only thrown everything way out of whack to the point where the counter effect to what we have been doing these last hundred or so years is going to come raging back in a huge way and will likely cause us to cease to exist.

Yes, this sounds pessimistic, but I can't see how our species can avoid our own extinction unless we acknowledge the fact that we are all deeply addicted to money and a broken system that rewards greed and unnatural behavior to get ahead of everything else. We are too smart for our own good and it is starting to already bite us in the ass. We have decimated our fragile ecosystem that allows us to survive and we currently have no plan to prevent the rapidly approaching destruction of our climate and natural world.

You may not see it, but I would take some time to sit and really think about everything going on right now and ask yourself, "is this what I imagined life would be like right now? AI, fascism, and global climate change intersecting to create a powder keg of chaos and the end of all things I hold dear?". Maybe you don't believe me on this, but you sir are just in denial of what is taking place. Either that or you are too numb to feel it like the rest of us do.

To be fair, it can be hard to see things for what they are if you are wealthy, numb, or dealing with a lot of things in your life that distract you from the truth. I have been homeless for over two and half years now and it has taken a good part of that time to come to terms with the reality of the situation, which is much easier to see when your in my shoes. When you are already struggling and an outcast to society, it is much easier to see things for what they are. You see the greed, the pain, the suffering, and how normal people just completely pass by all the beautiful things in life without stopping - for the sake of money, things, and the distractions that hold our attention from life itself.

I guess that has been one of the blessings of this suffering I've endured and tried to end, but I don't know if that is really the point of it all - the suffering and getting out of homelessness is what I mean. I think this whole experience was necessary for me to see the true nature of life and what is important to me. I no longer see my career, making money, or obtaining things as the key to my happiness - it is right here with me all the time when I am able to notice it. It also sits right next to misery, which I must also acknowledge and accept if I am to experience happiness, right? Everything is a delicate balance.

The things that once were important to me were the very things that made me a miserable and depressed fuck who drank alcohol to oblivion. Now, I'm not going to go ahead and say things are perfect, because they are very far from that. But what I can say is that I am happier than I've ever been and it is hard to say exactly why.

One big reason is that money is not my sole focus, but rather survival. Surviving is the number one thing I wake up and focus on each day and it is hard, really fucking hard. But I do know I get to spend each day with my best friend and fiance, who is somebody who I love more than anyone on the planet. Our life is hard as we are basically outcasts here in this capitalist world, but we have each other and that is what we both care about. We are holding on until we get a better opportunity, and if that doesn't come, we will continue to hold on because of our love for each other, pure and simple.

Wake up and see past money, work, and things. See the beauty: hold it, love it, and share it with everyone you love and everyone who needs love!

Happy Sunday.
