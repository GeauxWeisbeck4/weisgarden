## 10:19 PM EST - Saturday Night @Wegman's in Chapel Hill, NC

I am feeling quite satisfied with myself :) 

I got a lot done and now finally get to start writing about stuff that matters, yay! I've told myself once I get to that point, it's time to start sharing this site and getting visitors, so let's see what we can do here...

Anyways, just a quick drop into Andrew's life:

> *Currently sitting inside the Wegman's at Chapel Hill, NC with the coolest person I could be with, Lisa, and doing my favorite thing ever, programming and writing. Oooh I feel so good right now. I am about to slice my spoon into a Friendly's Ice Cream Cake Sundae and I just don't know what might happen then. God Bless Saturdays...*

And that has been your WeisGarden update for today - read on to learn something interesting, find some heady new tunes, or start searching for ways to hack my site all you computer wizards ðŸ˜ˆ - just make sure to tell me first and don't do anything illegal, there's a huge bug bounty in it for you ðŸ˜‰.

## What's on My Mind:

Well it was an eventful day so plenty of things to think about, but there is one thing that stuck out to me and it is one that goes a long with letting my readers get to know who I am a bit better... we're going to talk about economics, wealth inequality, and fascism - ahh yes, perfect topic for today, right? The No Kings Protest all over the country were successful and we have a fascist takeover happening right now so I think now is about as good of a time as ever to hop right into things!

First of all, I'm going to ask you to indulge me by participating in a small exercise... yes, an exercise and I will even throw a commenting feature on the site ASAP to accomodate for your responses. We are going to play a quick game of comment your answers first, then finish reading the article second just to teach everyone a little something here. Ok, please stop reading past this list of questions, scroll down to the bottom of the page, comment your answers, and then back here to finish the article - you don't have to do it that way, but it will make reading this less fun. Who knows, you will maybe even prove me wrong?

Ok, well enough chit chat, lets get right down to these five questions (I have an example below each for demonstrative purposes):

1. What is the biggest stressor in your life right now? Answer generally, then answer more specifically.
   1. *General: Education Specific: My math test in the morning.*
2. Explain what the term "American Dream" means to you and does achieving that mean you are successful and/or happy? Answer in your own words.
   1. *American Dream is a dream with a bald eagle flying George Washington around as he holds an American Flag and fires a machine gun at a crowd of terrorists. I don't know if anybody but George Washington could achieve that and he was successful, so I say yes.*
3. Without looking up any definition, explain economics as you understand it. What does economics measure, teach us, and help us do? 
   1. *Economics is the study of my relationship to money. It measures how my money makes me rich, it teaches me to hate poor people, and it helps me get more rich*
4. Why do you love or hate capitalism? Is it better than communism? Is it sustainable, fair, and efficient? Or is it destructive, unfair, and rigged? You tell me, you don't get my opinion on this... ever.
   1. *Capitalism is bitchin dude - I just bought these shade glasses things from the dollar tree and chicks so dig em, even though I can't really see and walked into the wall a bunch. Uh I dunno yeah, yeah, and yeah - would you stop with the stupid sissy questions? Damn...*
5. What do all these things have to do with the rise in fascism/authoritarianism/totalitarianism we see today? Or are they unrelated? Or is that just liberal media made up bs that is created to stop Trump from blowing open the secret satanic pedophile cabal in the government?
   1. *Nazis - it all has to do with Nazis... I think. I dunno, maybe they are? Didn't the Nazis like do all this because they met aliens that were tall and white? Yeah TRUMP 2028!*

[*] *You can answer the questions however you want to - the more in depth you are the better. Let's get a good converstation going. This will really help you in understanding the next part better.*

### The Answer is More Simple Than You Think...

So you have answered your questions and you are eager to see what I am going to say about these topics... well, I have some bad news for you - I can answer all these questions simply for you with one piece of advice... advice that will change your life. Advice we all need to hear... but I am not going to do that yet! 

Why? I know you're probably thinking:

*"Oh what a dick head - he's probably trying to string me a long and get me to spend money on some stupid course or something so fuck this I'm out..."*

WRONG! I am an indie hacker and totally will not sell you on a stupid digital product you don't need, thank you very much. I have been homeless for over two years and think I could manage just fine until I die, which I totally am not saying that I want that, but I am totally saying that I am very happy with who I am, my life, my partner, and my understanding of the world - in fact I love it all so much, I would recommend sending me a Cash App to $GeauxWeisbeck for whatever amount of Bitcoin or USD that you wish! It would help me so much!

But no, nothing you will do is going to give you the ultimate nugget of knowlege that will make your life so much better, filled with less stress, and free from bondage of tyrranny, life, and everything that keeps you awake at night. You will get it all the time from me, you will hear me say it all the time, and you can pick it up if you are reading and listening very, very closely to the main idea of what I am always talking about. It's the secret to a happy life and success in everything you do, so pay close attention!

So did you answer yet? If not, go back up and do it please. It will be so much more interesting if you do and helpful if you do. It will be a good start on this journey of self realization, happiness, and becoming the smartest and amazingest person on the planet, just like me! So do those questions, comment, and come back up here. 

### So no answer... What are you going to talk about then?

Here's my quick answer to all the questions:

- [1] The biggest stressor in my life is (a. General) being homeless and dealing with homeless challenges and other homeless people. (b. Specific) A tweaker couple that steals the cats from our homeless people house (our tent), killed a goose we were trying to rescue, and is sublimalinally threatening my life. I am trying to figure out how to make this all stop because we've tried everything - I will try everything I need to to make it stop, minus killing anyone of course. 
- [2] The American Dream is not real, but a marketing tactic to push consumerism, AKA Capitalism on an entire population of intelligent and hard working people - only the marketing company can achieve their objective here so, no you can't be successful, at least personally you probably won't be.
- [3] Economics is the study of human behavior in relation to the comparative advantage decisions they make every single day in order to maximize their overall utility. Economics measures the trade off value of your decisions, it teaches us that time is valuable, and it helps us exchange value with other humans.
- [4] I hate capitalism because unless it is stopped, our world will end as we know it within 10 years, likely shorter. I think any idea that is not balanced is a bad one, so no communism is bad too. It is fucked up, makes the rich richer but leaves everyone else poorer, and strips the world of everything that makes it pure, beautiful, and rare. And before you say: *"Andrew, but capitalism has made our standard of living better than ever before!"*, think about this first... is our standard of living good when one person has so much of everything that they waste something someone somewhere else doesn't have, but the persone who really needs the thing that other person is wasting doesn't have the economic capabilities to acquire it before it is thrown away, and so they have to resort to crime or dig it out of the trash, only to have consequences for those actions that get them locked up and set back in life. It is a system of greed, corruption, and is now run by a croney government who has no problem sucking all your money away from you.
- [5] Authoritarianism is always lurking and waiting for the opportunity to creep back in and take over. In the 1920s, 30s, and 40s it rode in on the back of European Nationalism and economic insecurity and we ended up with the one of the most horrific genocides in the history of the world. It has popped up in other countries, been beat back, came back, and maybe even always been everywhere, just waiting for its opportunity to strike. The infrastructure for a long-term plan has been put into place and all the other pieces have slowly been very carefully placed into their positions, ready to carry out a plan against all of us who want nothing more than our own freedom, privacy, and to be treated fair and just. I want to keep saying more, but this is a whole separate post that needs to be right, so I'll leave it there.

Again, these are pretty brief because it is how I would answer them in the comments, which you are wondering what the point of all this is? First, and most practically, discussion is important in building a following and community, but most importantly, it helps everyone learn from each other. The second reason is that you will be thinking more about this stuff in your daily life and more likely to take action to save the world - taking action like responding in comments makes you think about these topics more, hear other people's point of views, and consciously consider the impact on how all these things can impact your very own life.

Seems different, maybe a bit odd, and maybe nobody will respond but it's a good practice to start. Now that we understand that, we're good and I can wrap up today's ideas into a more cohesive message that helps the readers to learn more about me and why I write.

### The Main Idea: Listen, Learn, Pay Attention, and Take Action

If there's one thing I've learned in this difficult two to three year period of living a pretty non-normal life, it is that there is nothing wrong with doing things the long and hard way - hell, I prefer it that way because I'll even go as far as saying it is kathardic, fulfulling, and real. One of the key words about the experience I've had in life, is that it has been very real and it has made me very real. It makes me see the world for what it is and it has helped me understand that the single most valuable things we have are our time, freedom, and the real experiences that we experience in the outside world, key word: outside. We have relegated our lives to a system built on control, profit, and increasing numbers to make people give your more of their time and resources, but the question I always ask myself is how have we missed everything going on for so long, ending up at a point where we feel humanity and the world is at a crossing point?

While I feel like I have understood these things for a while, I was so caught up in the distraction of everything that I really missed the solution, or rather, the main idea or point. I need to slow down so I can listen, learn, pay attention, and take action if I want to be useful in changing the way things are going. It was never going to be possible with the way I was living life, so becoming homeless was a blessing in disguise. Suffering and struggling every single day to get by and living a raw, real daily experience has made me a new man, a better man.

There's a reason that things don't always seem as they are for a reason - because they aren't as they seem. The whole smoking mirror is the shit the media puts out to distract you from what is really going on: corruption, theft, a take over of your democracy by violating the very contract that we all follow to make this thing work. I didn't understand this for a while, but democracy is alredy dead - they killed it a long time ago. We are in the midst of them doing the takeover of society - think about the rapid advancement of tech and who owns all of the wealth that comes from that. That's capitalism - it's a system that rewards money, success, and fame, costs be damned. It is all about money, it has always been about money, and it will always continue to be about the money.

From money stems power, from mower stems control, and from control stems dominance. Humans are animals and the worst of us trend toward that tendancy and their efforts become amplified when they get control of lots of wealth, assets, and people. We have allowed billionaires to begin commandeering our world as we know it and won't stop until they get what they want - total control of everything, even if it is just ruins. Someday we'll learn more about this as I keep writing, but just know that it is more than just life or death at this point - it is the survival of the world that is at stake.

You might think I'm on some rambling, nonsensical or conspiratorial bull shit, but I urge you to read my work for a little while and what I am saying will make sense. I've seen this up, close, and personal, while also living on a very radical spectrum of society that makes you partial or even ambivalent to the stupid things that all forms of media put out there to turn our eyes to things they want us to. Our reality is carefully crafted and a narrative is supposed to be followed. When that narrative is not followed, you are socially cast into a situation that makes you think twice about defying that reality ever again. They'll continue that until you learn your lesson or conform back with their manufactured reality that they've created for you.

The value you I have to offer is in the form of an education that is vital for your survival, so this digital garden may be the most valuable resource that you ever come across. You might not like what I'm saying or call it crazy and stop reading, but I urge you to hang around until you understand the things I'm saying are important and until they start to make sense and become more clear. I've done a lot of shit and failed a lot - I'm a valuable resource so stick around if you want to learn some real shit.

## Conclusion
