## Sprint 30 (09/08 - 09/21)

The 30th sprint that I've started since I began this method of tracking productivity is currently underway. There have been a lot of challenges, ups and downs, and I have a lot of work to do to catch up. First I will discuss the sprint goals I came up with on Sunday before kicking this two week sprint off. Next, I will give a brief recap on the couple productive days I've had then will get into what's next.
