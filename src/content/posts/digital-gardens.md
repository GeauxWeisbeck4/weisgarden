## Digital Gardens: An Overview

> "It's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation. The essay was part of a larger metaphorical conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext."
> — Maggie Appleton: A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden.

What exactly is a digital garden, you might ask? The defintion of a Digital Garden is not absolute–it is a relatively new term that has gained popularly recently, that describes online spaces that are moreso dedicated to the act of learning and growth, rather than final products.

> "It's less than a blog, more than a tweet." As part of my exploration of digital gardens.
> — Inspired by Anna and Kelly Pendergrast

As you can see, the term and idea are a bit of a rabbit hole. For a far more thorough explanation and examples of other digital gardens, please visit Maggie's repository: Digital-Gardeners.

> "A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital grdeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public."
> —From Ness Labs

## Vocabulary

- **Seeds**
  - Seed your garden with quality content and cultivate your curiosity. Plant seeds in your mind garden by taking smart personal notes (taking raw notes is useless). These don't need to be written in a publishable form.
- **Trees**
  - Grow your knowledge by forming new branches and connecting the dots. Write short structured notes articulating specific ideas and publish them in your digital garden.
  - One note in your digital garden = one idea. (what you're currently reading is such a note) Do not keep orphan notes. Thread your thoughts.
- **Fruits**
  - Produce new work. These are more substantial—essays, videos, maybe a book at some point. The kind of work researchers and creatives may hope will help them live beyond their expiration date.

## The Philosophy of Digital Gardens

*NOTE: This section is largely taken from Anne-Laure Le Cunff and her website MentalNodes.com*

**Digital Gardens solve two problems:**

Our ability to COMMUNICATE and SHARE on the internet in novel, positive ways.
Our ability to COMPRHEND and SYNTHESIZE information with emphasis on CREATIVITY rather than CONSUMPTION.

Lavoisier once said: “Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme” — meaning:
“Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.”There are three simple rules to go from collector to creator:

**Collect. Note-taking, raw snippets, Kindle highlights + personal commentary.**
**Connect. Link to previous notes. Do not keep orphan notes.**
**Create. Write original article.**

Many note-takers hoard content because it gives them an illusion of knowledge.

The best way to truly understand anything is to use the generation effect: to produce your own content, in your own words, and to share it with the world to create a feedback loop.The only way to learn in public is to build in public.

Linear thinking is a ultimately a myth. Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas.Our natural fear of being judged leads most people to build, learn, and think privately. But seeking validation should not be the goal of learning in public.

Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.

Hence why you do not keep orphan notes: Every time you write a new note, make sure to go back to previous notes and to interlink them together. Orphan notes do not contribute to the serendipitous creation of new insights. Only by connecting notes together can we go from collector to creator.
