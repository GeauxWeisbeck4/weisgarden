## 11:49 PM, Wegman's in Chapel Hill

So I had a lot going on in the professional world this week and in the open source/personal projects world this week. Here is a quick breakdown of what I've been up to:

- I am working on a MongoDB Query Builder tool for Deno and am almost ready to upload it to JSR.io. It will be my first package I've uploaded to the Deno version of NPM. More to come soon...
- Designing out a CFB API that I am creating as the backend for a stats app/website sort of like Baseball Savant. This will take some time to get all the features I want down, but I will have a simple MVP out shortly!
- Contacted about a Senior Full Stack Developer job that looks really interesting and I am excited about. I am going to update my resume and then schedule a call to see what it's all about. Maybe something will work out there!

Overall a positive week with lots of ups and downs like usual, which isn't surprising for me. 

Well Wegman's is about to close, so I must bounce. I may update this post to include a couple more things later on, but I gotta go y'alls!
