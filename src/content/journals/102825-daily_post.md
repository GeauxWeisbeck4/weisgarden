## 10:55 PM - Tuesday Evening

Sitting here trying to get some reading in at David's before we are back out to the cold in our tent. I need to get some work done, mainly learning shit, reading, and coding tonight so I can get back on track. I also need to get some work done on this website and get back in the habit of building shit pretty regularly and making GitHub contributions. 

## Listening:

## Working On:

- [WeisGarden](https://weisgarden.netlify.app)
  - Finish the support page and projects page. Add a journal section and tidy things up a bit. Add tasks to Asana.
- [Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://third-bit.com)
  - Reading the books by Greg Wilson and review some of his content to learn and get caught back up on Software Architecture.

## Where I'm Working:

- Jim's Shop
  - Our buddy David works for his roommate who has a shop that is really cool. Chilling and getting some work done before we gotta go.
