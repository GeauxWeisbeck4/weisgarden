## 11:43 PM on a Saturday Night in Durham...

As I sit and think about all the things I've done in my life, there is one thing that seems to trouble me more than the rest, for it causes me despair and pain like no human should ever have to endure. That is being born into a family of Nebraska Cornhusker fans (well my Mom actually married into that family to be technical about it). To be a Husker fan is the worst fate one can bestow upon a man of sport and athletics.

When did it all begin? Because it wasn't always this way you know... mostly so, but for a long time, the Huskers reigned king over the college football landscape. Then, an abrupt fall from grace, forever doomed to mediocrity and shitty football. Ugh...
