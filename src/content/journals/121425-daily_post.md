## 10:29 PM on a Sunday Night in Durham, NC

It is so mother fucking cold outside - like literally 10 degrees or something. I have to go sleep out in that shit, so lord have mercy. We at least got a propane tank which should help keep us warm, but god damn...

Anyways, I got off to a good start this morning working on shit, but I went out to go try and make money panhandling and it derailed the rest of my day mostly. I mean, I don't necessarily hate panhandling - there's a lot worse shit to be doing than holding a sign. It's just that I haven't gotten a good chance to work on the important shit we need to get done.

Well, there's not use in sitting and reflecting on what should have been done better. Let's see what was learned and worked on today.

## Reading & Learning
  
- **Math for Programming**
  - Worked through Chapter 1, which is about how computers represent numbers, how to convert between binary and decimal, etc.
- **Unleash the Power of Storytelling**
  - Read intro and chapter one and also started chapter two
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - Read through Python and Javascript books on O'Reilly briefly
  - Building a project around this

## Projects

- **WeisGarden**
  - Added journal entry
  - Working on Support page
  - Working on About Me page

## Ideas

- **Resources For Folks Who are Struggling with Homelessness**
  - I will be using this myself 😃
- **Library App**
  - Users can add books to their library, write a review, etc.

## Reflection

I really wish I woulda kept with working on all this shit this morning cause I was way off track when I wanted to get back to work on my stuff. But no biggie, I'm going to remain positive overall in regards to how things went.

And I'm off to tomorrow most likely - later y'all!
