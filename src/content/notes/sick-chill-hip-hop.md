This can be thought of the ultimate Awesome list for the Chill Hip Hop genre, well at least that I have been able to discover so far. Please [contact me](https://weisgarden.netlify.app/contact) with something that you think should be added into this list. After you send me the song, artist, sample, or whatever, I will evaluate it's quality and will create a method to check with other fans who enjoy this subcategory of music via polls or other methods for asking the greater community if is good enough for this list. 

This is some high-ass-quality taste here, so you better know your shit, otherwise you will never see your suggestion make the day of light here. This shit is serious though.

## Artists and Song (Album)
